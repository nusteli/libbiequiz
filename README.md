Open the repo in browser (where you are right now!)

1. Click images/ folder
2. Click Add file → Upload files
3. Drag image(s) in
4. Click Commit changes
5. Getting the usable link (the key step)
> Click the uploaded image file in GitHub
> Follow this template: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nusteli/libbiequiz/main/images/FILENAME.jpg
> >Replace FILENAME.jpg with your uploaded image filename and extension
6. Paste the full URL into QImage1 / QImage2 / QImage3 in Google Sheets

_TIP: If the link contains github.com/.../blob/... it’s wrong. It must be **raw**.githubusercontent.com/...._

Do **NOT** edit files in /config.
