Open the repo in browser (where you are right now!)

1. Click images/ folder
2. Click Add file → Upload files
3. Drag image(s) in
4. Click Commit changes
5. Getting the usable link (the key step)
> Click the uploaded image file in GitHub
> Click Raw
> Copy the URL in the address bar
  It will look like:
> > https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/<repo>/<branch>/images/<filename>.png
6. Paste that into QImage1 / QImage2 / QImage3 in Google Sheets.

_TIP: If the link contains github.com/.../blob/... it’s wrong. It must be **raw**.githubusercontent.com/...._
